This project applies a Linear Regression model to predict students’ final grades (G3) using their first two grades (G1, G2) along with weekday (Dalc) and weekend (Walc) alcohol consumption as features. The dataset student-mat.csv is split into training and testing sets, the model is trained, and predictions are generated. These predictions are rounded to whole numbers and clipped to stay within the valid grade range of 0–20. The results, including actual and predicted grades, are saved in a CSV file named student_grade_predictions_rounded.csv. Model performance is evaluated using R² Score and Mean Absolute Error (MAE), providing insight into how well the model explains grade variance and the average prediction error.
